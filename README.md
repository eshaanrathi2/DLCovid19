## Dataset Discription

The dataset used in this study has been taken from https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT 

The COVID-CT-Dataset has 349 CT images containing clinical findings of COVID-19 from 216 patients. They are in `./Images-processed/CT_COVID.zip`

** Note: *The utility of this dataset has been confirmed by a senior radiologist in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, who has performed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of COVID-19 patients during the outbreak of this disease between January and April.*

The following two images has been taken from the above given dataset, where left image is of covid patient and right image is of non-covid patient.
